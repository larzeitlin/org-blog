* How to add a new blog post

** Create a new org file
Create a new org file in the posts directory, for example:

=cd posts=

=touch my_new_blog_post.org=

** See the org mode docs for syntax

[[https://orgmode.org][Org Mode Docs]]


*** Add headers
Ensure at least the =#+TITLE= header is included.
This is used to name the post.
Look at [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/larzeitlin/orgblogcljs/main/posts/2021_11_28_how_to_add_a_new_post.org][this .org file]] for this post to see example headers.

** Compile
Org files are ingested by a CLJ macro at compile time. To force compilation run:

=npx shadow-cljs compile app=

** Run locally
To run the blog locally use:

=npx shadow-cljs watch app=

** Release it
Once you are happy, run this before pushing it to whever you are hosting it:

=npx shadow-cljs release app=
